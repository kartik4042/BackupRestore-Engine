# Distributed Backup and Restore System with Automation

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a Distributed Storage Backup and Restore System designed to securely back up and restore data from MongoDB databases. The system focuses on efficient backup management, scalability, high availability, and automation using Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible. It provides users with a set of RESTful APIs that allow them to trigger backups, check backup statuses, and restore databases easily. The system is automated, scalable, and fault-tolerant.

## Key Features

### MongoDB Backup and Restore API
- **RESTful API**: Allows users to back up and restore MongoDB data.
- **Full & Incremental Backups**: Supports both types of backups for flexibility.
- **Backup Scheduling & Retention**: Allows users to define backup schedules and retention policies.

### Backup Status and History
- **View Backup Status**: API to get the status of ongoing and completed backups.
- **Backup History**: Lists backup metadata including date, size, and type (full/incremental).

### Security
- **Data Encryption**: Ensures that backup data is encrypted for security.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Provides mechanisms to control access to backup operations.

### Scalability and High Availability
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Ensures that the system scales automatically based on demand.
- **Docker Containers**: Provides isolated environments for MongoDB and backup services.
- **Kubernetes StatefulSets**: Ensures high availability and persistent storage for MongoDB deployments.

### Automated Infrastructure Provisioning and Configuration
- **Ansible Automation**: Automates the deployment of MongoDB clusters and backup services across multiple environments (dev, staging, production).
- **Backup Scheduling & Monitoring**: Automated backup scheduling and monitoring using Ansible playbooks.

### API Testing with RESTer
- **API Testing**: Uses the RESTer extension to test and validate backup and restore API endpoints during development.

### Swagger Documentation
- **API Documentation**: Fully documented API endpoints using Swagger for easy reference by developers and system admins.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js or Python (Flask/Django) for building RESTful API endpoints.
- **Database**: MongoDB to store backup metadata (e.g., backup status, history).
- **Containerization**: Docker for containerizing the backup system and MongoDB database.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for scaling and managing backup services and MongoDB in a distributed environment.
- **Automation**: Ansible for automating infrastructure provisioning, including MongoDB clusters and backup services.
- **API Testing**: RESTer for testing and validating the API during development.

## Use Case

Company X requires a reliable backup and restore system for MongoDB databases. This solution automates backup processes, ensures that backups are securely stored, and provides an easy restoration mechanism. The system scales automatically with increasing data loads, ensuring high availability and reliability.

## Project Workflow

1. **Backup Triggered**: The user triggers a backup via the Swagger-documented RESTful API.
2. **Backup Processing**: The system processes the backup and stores metadata in MongoDB.
3. **Backup Status**: Real-time updates on backup progress are available through the API.
4. **Restore Operation**: In case of data loss, users can restore the database from a specific backup using the API.
5. **Infrastructure Management**: Kubernetes scales the backup system automatically based on demand and workload, ensuring high availability.

## Benefits

- **Fully Automated**: Backup and restore processes are automated, reducing manual intervention.
- **Scalable & Fault-Tolerant**: The use of Docker and Kubernetes ensures scalability and resilience to failures.
- **User-Friendly API**: Well-documented API endpoints make it easy for users and developers to interact with the system.
- **Security & Compliance**: Backups are encrypted to meet industry security and compliance standards.
